# Name of Project:
Login Page Using Selenium WebDriver

# Project's Purpose or Goal: 
The proposed of the project aims to develop a web automation script using Selenium WebDriver and C# programming language.  It can be used to automate the login process, search for specific products or content, and interact with other users on a social media website. This can save users time and effort by automating repetitive tasks and allowing them to focus on other important tasks.

# Minimum features needed to neet goal
* The project should be a console application that uses Selenium WebDriver and C# to automate a website's functionality.
* The application should be able to launch the website and navigate to the login page (if applicable).
* The script should be able to enter the user's login credentials and click the login button.

# Tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and other resources
* C# 
* Selenium Webdriver
* Visual Studio 2022, MSTest
* Chrome Driver

# If minimum viable product (MVP) is reached.  What additional features to work: 
* Error handling: Implement error handling to handle any exceptions or errors that may occur during the automation process.
* Reporting: Generate reports that summarize the test results, including any failures or errors encountered during the automation process.
* Parameterization: Allow users to provide input values, such as login credentials, search queries, or product names, as parameters to the script.

# Additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources require?
*  Log4Net or NLog, to log any exceptions or errors that occur during the automation process. 
* A testing framework, such as NUnit or xUnit, can provide built-in reporting functionality, making it easier to generate test reports.
